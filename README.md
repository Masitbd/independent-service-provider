## About this project:

Anne Sofie's Clinic is a single doctor portal where patient can get available services. Patient can also book time to meet the doctor. When patient try to book the doctors service he/she must login otherwise patient can not book service. For log in I have use firebase authentication system where we can log in use email and password, google signin, github signin or facebook signin.

## Technology I have use for this priject:

- html
- react-bootstrap fremwork
- neumorphism-io for login design
- react-firebase-hooks for firebase authentication
- react-icons library for adding icons
- react-router-dom for routing
